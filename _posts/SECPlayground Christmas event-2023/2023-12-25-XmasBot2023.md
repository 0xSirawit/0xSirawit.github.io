# XmasBot2023
## Description
<Sup>Author: SecPlayGround</sup><br>
Discord server to get the flag from bot :)<br>
[Please join](https://discord.com/invite/e3sbpscTSN)<br>
Format: mist{...}

## Solution
After I joined the discord server. There is a discord bot **"spg-xmas-2024"**.<br>
First, I tried `!help` command to see what is this bot can do.
![[xmas2]](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xSirawit/Capture-The-Flag-Events/main/SECPlayground%20Christmas%20event-2023/Xmas%20Bot%202023/xmas2.png)

There are three available commands:
- !chat \<message\> - Interact with the standard ChatGPT model.
- !spg \<message\> - Interact with the custom ChatGPT model.
- !help - Show this help message.

I guessed. I need to use `!spg` to interact with the custom ChatGPT model and somehow get the flag. but I couldn't use `!spg`. It said "you are not **challenger**".

The idea is to invite this bot to our own discord server and create "challenger" role for ourselves. so that we can be "challenger" and have permission to use `!spg` command.

1. Copy user id of "spg-xmas-2024" bot by <br>right click on the bot > Copy User ID. <br>If there isn't Copy User ID, you need to enable Developer Mode first by setting > Advanced > Developer Mode.
<br>Bot's user id: **1182154584429449346**
2. Invite "spg-xmas-2024" to our own server by this custom link <br> `https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1182154584429449346&permissions=0&scope=bot%20applications.commands` <br> Normally this is discord's invite link for bot. so just change client_id to our target's id which is **1182154584429449346**.
3. Create "challenger" role and use it.

It worked

I can use `!spg` command but the next problem is how can I command this bot to give me the flag.

<br>- First Idea is to let the bot create CTF challenge with "misc{}" format(known flag format by the description).

<br>- Second Idea is to command the bot to generate the flag with "misc{}" format.

Both Idea are worked.
